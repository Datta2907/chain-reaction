Chain Reaction Game

Overview
Chain Reaction is a turn-based strategy game where players take turns placing their colored orbs on a grid. 
When a cell reaches its limit, the orbs explode, spreading to adjacent cells and potentially capturing the opponent's orbs. 
The goal is to dominate the grid by eliminating the opponent's orbs.

How to Play

1. Players and Turns
   - The game supports two players, each assigned a color (Red and Green).
   - Players take turns placing an orb in an empty cell or a cell they already own.
   - The first player starts as Red, followed by Green.

2. Placing Orbs
   - Click on a grid cell to place an orb of your color.
   - You can only place orbs in empty cells or cells that already contain your orbs.

3. Chain Reaction Mechanism
   - Each cell has a capacity:
     - Corner cells can hold up to 1 orb.
     - Edge cells can hold up to 2 orbs.
     - Inner cells can hold up to 3 orbs.
   - When a cell reaches its limit, the orbs explode and distribute to adjacent cells.
   - If adjacent cells belong to the opponent, they are captured and converted to the exploding player's color.
   - This can trigger chain reactions, causing multiple explosions in a single turn.

4. Winning Condition
   - A player wins when their opponent has no orbs left on the grid.

Controls
- Click on a cell to place an orb.
- The game will automatically update orbs and trigger chain reactions when needed.
